In this project, I used a flexdashboard to present my research paper. The final presentation could be found in fp_dashboard.html (need to be downloaded in order to view the page).

Packages used in the code:
<br>library(tidyverse)
<br>library(dotwhisker)
<br>library(broom)
<br>library(sjPlot) 
<br>library(ggcorrplot) 
<br>library(plotly)
<br>library(knitr)

(Note: the ggplotly graph will have a small grey bar in the legend, to get rid of it, just refresh the page.)
