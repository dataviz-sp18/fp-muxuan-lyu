In this project, I used a flexdashboard to present my research paper. The final presentation could be found in fp_dashboard.html. I tried my best to make more interactive plots as possible though some plots failed to do that, so I just paste an image of the results from ggplot.

(The ggplotly graph will have a small grey bar in the legend, to get rid of it, just refresh the page.)
